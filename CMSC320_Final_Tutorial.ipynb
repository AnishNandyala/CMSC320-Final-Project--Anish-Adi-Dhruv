        "Chess, as one of the most intellectually stimulating games, offers a enormous landscape for exploration and analysis. Beyond its plain game mechanics, each move in a chess game represents a strategic decisions, tactical maneuvers, and psychological warfare. In this data analysis, we will delve into the realm of chess games, not merely to admire the beauty of the game, but to unearth the hidden patterns and features that correlate with the ultimate goal: victory.\n",

        "Our Objective: to identify key features within chess games that significantly contribute to the win state. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing meta details of thousands of chess games. Factors such as time, opening moves, player ranks, and various other details can all provide different insights into how the game is going to go. By examining these features and their interplay with the game's outcome, we aim to uncover insights that show the path to winning in the world of chess.\n",

Here we create two different versions of our dataset. There are several groups of entries that do not have the game time recorded and this can be observed in the rows that represent no time difference between creation and last move time. We will create one dataframe that contains all original entries, so that we can analyze other aspects of the game, and one dataframe that contains the time difference for games that have  their time properly recorded. This way we are able to still analyze other aspects of the game using the original/larger dataframe, while eliminating incorrect 0 time difference games from the second dataframe."
